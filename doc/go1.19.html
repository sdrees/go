    <p><!-- CL 386016 -->
      The pure Go resolver will now use EDNS(0) to include a suggested
      maximum reply packet length, permitting reply packets to contain
      up to 1232 bytes (the previous maximum was 512).
      In the unlikely event that this causes problems with a local DNS
      resolver, setting the environment variable
      <code>GODEBUG=netdns=cgo</code> to use the cgo-based resolver
      should work.
      Please report any such problems on <a href="/issue/new">the
      issue tracker</a>.
